# Crappy Bird :poop:

It's like [Flappy Bird][link-flappy-bird], but crappier.

You can easily [play it in your browser][link-clappy-bird].

Running Crappy Bird locally will [require a web server][link-phaser-intro], which is a dependency of the [Phaser][link-phaser] game framework.

## Controls

* tap the up arrow to move the bird upwards
